abstract = {<p>Modern automobiles are no longer mere mechanical devices; they are pervasively monitored and controlled by dozens of digital computers coordinated via internal vehicular networks. While this transformation has driven major advancements in efficiency and safety, it has also introduced a range of new potential risks. In this paper we experimentally evaluate these issues on a modern automobile and demonstrate the fragility of the underlying system structure. We demonstrate that an attacker who is able to infiltrate virtually any Electronic Control Unit (ECU) can leverage this ability to completely circumvent a broad array of safety-critical systems. Over a range of experiments, both in the lab and in road tests, we demonstrate the ability to adversarially control a wide range of automotive functions and completely ignore driver input\dash including disabling the brakes, selectively braking individual wheels on demand, stopping the engine, and so on. We find that it is possible to bypass rudimentary network security protections within the car, such as maliciously bridging between our car's two internal subnets. We also present composite attacks that leverage individual weaknesses, including an attack that embeds malicious code in a car's telematics unit and that will completely erase any evidence of its presence after a crash. Looking forward, we discuss the complex challenges in addressing these vulnerabilities while considering the existing automotive ecosystem.</p>},

abstract = {As automobiles increase in functionality and convenience, they are increasingly connected via multiple wireless capabilities, which also increase access to a vehicle's Controller Area Network (CAN). CAN, the primary intra-vehicle network, allows time sensitive communication between electronic control units (ECU's), which are embedded systems that control invehicle systems. Although CAN has been proven very effective in data transfer, it wasn't designed with security in mind, and the lack of security may become a substantial vulnerability. While some steps could be taken to add security layers and features to the existing CAN protocol, introducing security adds cost, data latency, and potentially reduces data throughput. There is a growing need to secure CAN networks in a way that reduces the aforementioned affects. In an attempt to improve the security within an automobile without an overhaul to the popular CAN protocol, we've developed a simple but effective architecture that provides security primitives at the data-link layer. When combined with modern day network security techniques to it can improve security now, and further enable a number of future security features. The most notable feature is the concept of "Fail Secure" that would allow a compromised CAN network to enter a state of limited communication allowing the safety and control related functions to continue while isolating most if not all potentially malicious traffic. A flexible architecture such as this provides vehicle manufacturers with an option to securely architect their CAN networks in current and future vehicle designs. It would further enable a range of possible techniques aimed at mitigating the everincreasing number of risks on an automotive CAN network. This paper will introduce the secure CAN network architecture and the techniques employed to accomplish the desired security. It also presents a threat model and several motivational threat scenarios to illustrate the simplicity and effectiveness of its employment.},

abstract = {<p>Security is one of the key challenges in cyberphysical systems, because by their nature, any cyber attack against them can have physical repercussions. This is a critical issue for autonomous vehicles; if compromised in terms of their communications or computation they can cause considerable physical damage due to their mobility. Our aim here is to facilitate the automatic detection of cyber attacks on a robotic vehicle. For this purpose, we have developed a detection mechanism, which monitors real-time data from a large number of sources onboard the vehicle, including its sensors, networks and processing. Following a learning phase, where the vehicle is trained in a non-attack state on what values are considered normal, it is then subjected to a series of different cyber-physical and physical-cyber attacks. We approach the problem as a binary classification problem of whether the robot is able to self-detect when and whether it is under attack. Our experimental results show that the approach is promising for most attacks that the vehicle is subjected to. We further improve its performance by using weights that accentuate the anomalies that are less common thus improving overall performance of the detection mechanism for unknown attacks.</p>},
