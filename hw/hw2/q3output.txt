Moral Responsibility for Computing Artifacts: Five Rules, Version 27 

Rule 1: The people who design, develop, or deploy a computing artifact are morally responsible for that artifact,
and for the foreseeable effects of that artifact. This responsibility is shared with other people who design, develop,
deploy or knowingly use the artifact as part of a sociotechnical system.

Rule 2: The shared responsibility of computing artifacts is not a zero-sum game. The responsibility of an individual
is not reduced simply because more people become involved in designing, developing, deploying or using the
artifact. Instead, a person’s responsibility includes being answerable for the behaviors of the artifact and for the
artifact’s effects after deployment, to the degree to which these effects are reasonably foreseeable by that person. 

Rule 3: People who knowingly use a particular computing artifact are morally responsible for that use. 

Rule 4: People who knowingly design, develop, deploy, or use a computing artifact can do so responsibly only when
they make a reasonable effort to take into account the sociotechnical systems in which the artifact is embedded. 

Rule 5: People who design, develop, deploy, promote, or evaluate a computing artifact should not explicitly or
implicitly deceive users about the artifact or its foreseeable effects, or about the sociotechnical systems in which the
artifact is embedded.
